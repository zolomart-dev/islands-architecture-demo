# Astro Islands architecture demo

Islands architecture results in better frontend performance by helping you avoid monolithic JavaScript patterns and stripping all non-essential JavaScript from the page automatically

The term `component island` was first coined by `Etsy` frontend architect Katie `Sylor-Miller` in 2019.
This idea was then expanded on and documented in this post by `Preact` creator Jason Miller on August 11, 2020.


```sh
pnpm i
pnpm run dev

pnpm run build
```
